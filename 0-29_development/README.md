# MSc Thesis notebook repo - David Haasnoot \  `0-29_development`

## layout
- `0-29_development`: Notebooks from start to the end of development stages. Syntax and good practices still change a lot here
    - `nbs_0-10_Old_DA _syntax`: These are initial tests using old syntax. Show my process well but not useful for inspiration
    - `nbs_11-17_pre_snow`: All runs before snow was added: HBV syntax changes
    - `nbs_18-21_post_snow_real_data`: runs with real data including the snow syntax. There were some issues with getting hyperparameters to work..
    - `nbs_22_synthetics_obs`: Used to first test synthetic runs
    - `nbs_22-23_itterate_synthetic_1620500`: Tested different hyperparameter configurations on synthetic runs for catchment 01620500
    - `nbs_24_25_itterate_synthetic_1411300`: Tested different hyperparameter configurations on synthetic runs for catchment 01411300
    - `nbs_27_itterate_synthetic_14138900`: : Tested different hyperparameter configurations on synthetic runs for catchment 14138900
    - `nbs_28_Camels&test`: couple of test notebooks and sidetracked getting Caravan onf openDAP
    - `nbs_29_test_direct_real_6452000`: Testing results from nbs_22-27 on catchment 6452000
